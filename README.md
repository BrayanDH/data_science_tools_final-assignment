# Introduction
Hello, I am Brayan, a junior data scientist. I have always been fascinated by the field of data science and the power it holds in predicting and analyzing various aspects of our world.

#Area of a Triangle
In this Jupyter Notebook, I have included a simple Python function to calculate the area of a triangle. The function takes the base and height of the triangle as inputs and returns the calculated area. Let's try it out:

```
def area_triangulo(base, altura):
    return base * altura / 2
```

```
area_triangulo(5, 6)
```


The above code will calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and height of 6, and the result will be 15.0.

Feel free to explore the notebook further and check out other interesting data science projects and experiments that I have worked on.

Thank you for visiting my Jupyter Notebook!
